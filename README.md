# Relativistic-Electron-Flux-Prediction
This project is for the paper: Relativistic Electron Flux Prediction at Geosynchronous Orbit Based on the Neural Network and the Quantile Regression Method.

The project is based on the python language. 
The detailed information of the project structure can be found in the README(project structure).PNG.

The processed data, and all the codes are provided in the project. 
The primitive data files are too large (1.3G) to provide.
The results of the models are recorded in the log files in the folder "result2". 
However, the early results of models in our early work are not recorded in an well-organized way, which we haven't provided here.
